            <h3 class="mat-h3">What does <strong>R-UP</strong> stand for?</h3>
            <p class="mat-body">
                Resigned under pressure. This indicates the individual left because they were forced out, either by superiors or by investigations into their conduct.

            <h3 class="mat-h3">What is a mooch?</h3>
            <p class="mat-body">
                A mooch is the period of time between the hiring and firing of former Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci. Generally, the most used and accepted conversion is 1 mooch = 10 days. However, it can be argued that Scaramucci actually served 11 days. Due to the prevalence of the 10 day conversion, I decided to use it for this list.

            <h3 class="mat-h3">Who is included in the list?</h3>
            <p class="mat-body">
                Anyone in a high-level position who gets paid federal money and influences government policy. There is some subjectivity involved. Additionally, there is an inherent sampling bias: only departures noticed by the media get included.

            <h3 class="mat-h3">How precise is the data?</h3>
            <p class="mat-body">
                As precise as possible. In some instances, an exact date of departure could not be identified. In these situations, I either assigned the publishing date of the article announcing the staff change or I assigned the middle of the month, depending on which option seemed most appropriate in context.

            <h3 class="mat-h3">What if an individual held more than one position in the Trump administration?</h3>
            <p class="mat-body">
                Time spent in previous positions are not included; only the time spent in the most recent position is counted. This is because it would get too complicated to list time in multiple positions for a single individual.
            </p>
            <p class="mat-body">
                If an individual held two positions concurrently, the maximum time span is counted. For instance, Individual A held position 1 from March to December, as well as position 2 from June to December. Thus, Individual A’s time in position would be from March to December. The two concurrent roles would be listed in the “position” column.

            <h3 class="mat-h3">Why are some departure dates in the future?</h3>
            <p class="mat-body">
                Some individuals announced their resignation, effective at a future date. This date is listed as their departure date, even if they are still serving.
